# MDocReader
Reading Markdown documents (e.g., GitHub wiki)  
The initial purpose of this project is to help users who find it inconvenient to browse Github wikis by allowing them to view markdown-format wiki documents locally.  

### Usage
Extract the files from the compressed package into the wiki folder (at the same level as the markdown files), and then open MDocReader.exe.
